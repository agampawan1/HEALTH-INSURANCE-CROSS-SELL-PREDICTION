# HEALTH-INSURANCE-CROSS-SELL-PREDICTION

Predicting whether a customer would be interested in buying Vehicle Insurance so that the company can plan its communication strategy accordingly to reach out to those customers and optimize its business model and revenue.

The Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction project aims to help an insurance company predict whether its existing health insurance policyholders from the past year would also be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance. This predictive analysis will enable the company to target potential customers more effectively, optimize communication strategies, and enhance revenue generation. The dataset contains valuable information on customer demographics, vehicle-related details, and policy information. By employing machine learning algorithms and feature selection techniques, the project seeks to build a robust classification model for accurate predictions.

Insurance serves as a protective measure against potential financial losses, damages, illnesses, or death, with customers paying a specified premium to the insurance company. The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict customer interest in vehicle insurance based on historical health insurance data. Understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial for any insurance provider to enhance customer satisfaction and improve business operations. By utilizing data analytics and machine learning, the project aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making and customer targeting.

# Problem Statement
In the realm of insurance services, our client, an established insurance company, aims to leverage advanced data analytics to better understand customer behavior and preferences. They seek assistance in developing a sophisticated predictive model that can discern whether their current health insurance policyholders are likely to show interest in purchasing vehicle insurance as well. The insurance company wants to optimize its communication strategy and revenue generation by precisely identifying potential customers for vehicle insurance.
As an insurance provider, the company is committed to providing a guarantee of compensation for specified losses, damages, illnesses, or unfortunate events, contingent upon regular premium payments made by their policyholders. To illustrate, imagine a customer paying an annual premium of Rs. 5000 for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000. If the customer falls ill and requires hospitalization, the insurance company will cover the hospitalization expenses up to Rs. 200,000. The concept of probabilities comes into play here, as only a few customers out of many will likely require such coverage in a given year. This way, the risk is distributed among all policyholders.

Similarly, the insurance company offers vehicle insurance where customers pay an annual premium to receive compensation (sum assured) in the unfortunate event of an accident involving their vehicle. Building a powerful predictive model that can forecast customer interest in vehicle insurance holds immense significance for the company. By achieving this, the company can strategically plan its communication efforts, reaching out to the right audience and refining its business model to maximize revenue.
To facilitate this predictive model's development, the company possesses a comprehensive dataset encompassing vital customer demographics (gender, age, region code type), vehicle details (vehicle age, damage), and policy information (premium, sourcing channel). Utilizing this rich dataset, the goal is to create a highly accurate predictive model that can distinguish between customers likely to be interested in vehicle insurance and those who may not show such interest among the existing health insurance policyholders.

Successfully implementing this predictive model will offer significant advantages for the insurance company. By accurately identifying potential vehicle insurance customers within their current health insurance policyholder base, the company can focus its resources efficiently and tailor its marketing strategies to address specific customer needs. This data-driven approach will lead to enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately solidifying the company's position as a leading insurance provider.

Moreover, the predictive model will empower the insurance company to stay ahead in a competitive market landscape. Informed decision-making, driven by data insights, will foster a customer-centric approach, establishing deeper connections with customers and driving long-term business success. The predictive model's implications will transcend mere revenue optimization, allowing the company to uphold its commitment to providing exemplary insurance services while meeting evolving customer expectations.

# Approach:
# 1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

The first step involved thorough data cleaning to identify and handle any missing values or duplicates. As the dataset was free of such issues, data normalization was performed to bring numerical features to a consistent scale, ensuring fair comparisons during analysis.

# 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA was carried out to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations, and trends. Age was categorized into different groups to better understand customer demographics. Additionally, features like Region_Code and Policy_Sales_Channel were analyzed to extract meaningful information.

# 3.Feature Selection:

To identify the most influential features, both numerical and categorical, feature selection techniques like Kendall's rank correlation coefficient and Mutual Information were employed. These techniques helped us identify the key variables that impact customer interest in vehicle insurance

# 4.Model Prediction:

The project utilized various supervised machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. Decision Tree Classifier, AdaBoost, LightGBM, Bagging Regressor, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression were among the models evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was applied to improve the accuracy of the models and mitigate overfitting.

# Conclusion:

Starting from loading our dataset, we initially checked for null values and duplicates. There were no null values and duplicates so treatment of such was not required. Through Exploratory Data Analysis,we observed that customers belonging to youngAge are more interested in vehicle response.while Young people below 30 are not interested in vehicle insurance. We observed that customers having vehicles older than 2 years are more likely to be interested in vehicle insurance. Similarly, customers having damaged vehicles are more likely to be interested in vehicle insurance. The variable such as Age, Previously_insured,Annual_premium are more afecting the target variable. For Feature Selection, we applied the Mutual Information technique. Here we observed that Previously_Insured is the most important feature and has the highest impact on the dependent feature and there is no correlation between the two. We observed that the target variable was highly imbalanced.So this issue was solved by using Random Over Sample resampling technique. we applied feature scaling techniques to normalize our data to bring all features on the same scale and make it easier to process by ML algorithms. Further, we applied Machine Learning Algorithms to determine whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance.
For our predictive modeling, we evaluated multiple algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, RandomForest, XGBClassifier, and KNeighbors.
The Random Forest model demonstrated an impressive accuracy of 91%, signifying its ability to accurately classify customers interested in vehicle insurance. Additionally, it achieved a remarkable recall of 98%, indicating its proficiency in identifying true positive instances, a crucial aspect in correctly identifying potential customers. The model's precision of 86% underscores its capability to minimize false positive classifications, ensuring targeted and relevant communication strategies. Moreover, the F1 score of 92%, representing a harmonious balance between precision and recall, highlights the model's overall efficacy in handling imbalanced classes.Moreover, the model achieved an outstanding ROC-AUC score of 92%, a vital metric that measures the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative instances. This high score signifies the model's strong capability in distinguishing interested customers from non-interested ones.

In light of these outcomes, we confidently conclude that the RandomForest model is the most suitable choice for this classification task. Its high accuracy and robust ROC_AUC score indicate its efficacy in identifying potential customers interested in vehicle insurance among existing health insurance policyholders. As the insurance company endeavors to optimize its communication strategies and revenue generation, the RandomForest model will be instrumental in driving more personalized marketing efforts, enhancing customer satisfaction, and ensuring continued business success. By leveraging data insights and advanced machine learning techniques, the insurance company is poised to stay ahead in the competitive market landscape, cementing its position as a customer-centric and reliable insurance provider.
